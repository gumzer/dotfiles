vimrc.txt
=========

This is an older vim config file of mine.
It has a great advantage though: it's just
one file. So it's enough to drop it in your
HOME directory and you are good to go.

Usage:
------

Place it in your HOME folder and rename it
to `.vimrc`.


vimtutor_hun.txt
================

Hungarian translation of the tutorial that
you can launch with the `vimtutor` command.
